# Capstone_Project

Online Full-Stack Development Quiz Game

This capstone project presents an interactive online quiz game designed to test users' knowledge of core technologies and concepts within full-stack development. 

The web application will feature a user-friendly interface allowing participants to answer 20 moderately challenging multiple-choice questions covering topics such as front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js), back-end languages and frameworks (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, Ruby on Rails), database management (SQL/NoSQL), API design, and common development tools. 

Upon completion, the application will instantly provide a score out of 100, offering immediate feedback on the user's proficiency in full-stack development. The project will demonstrate a robust full-stack implementation, encompassing database management, secure user interaction, and dynamic content delivery.
